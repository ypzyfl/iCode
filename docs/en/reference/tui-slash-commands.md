# TUI slash command reference

Slash commands are shortcuts entered in the terminal user interface (TUI) input field. Use them to manage sessions, switch configurations, view information, and open feature dialogs.

## Enter slash commands

A slash command must start at the beginning of the input, with the command and its arguments on the same line.

- Valid example: `/diff` runs as a command.
- Invalid example: `Please run /diff` does not trigger a command.

After you type `/`, a command suggestion list appears above the input field. Keep typing to filter commands; press **Tab** to complete the selected command. If a command does not show argument suggestions, you can press **Enter** immediately after completing it to run it. If it accepts arguments, you can also continue typing arguments before pressing **Enter**.

The following commands show argument suggestions: `/theme`, `/language`, `/approval`, `/buddy`, `/agents`, `/settings`, and `/man`. The list opens when you complete one of these commands with **Tab**, or when you type the full command and press **Space** or **Enter**.

- Example: type `/approval` and press **Space** to see `Manual`, `Auto`, and `Bypass`.

Once the argument suggestion list appears, use the up and down arrow keys to select an item and press **Enter** to run it, or click the item with the mouse.

## View command help

Enter `/man` to view help for built-in slash commands:

- `/man`: press **Space** or **Enter** to show the list of commands with help available. Select a command to open its detailed help.
- `/man <command>`: open detailed help for a specific command. `command` can be a command name or alias, such as `/man theme`, `/man diff`, or `/man quit`.

## Command reference

The following table lists the built-in slash commands in AIxCoding.

In this table:

- `<arg>` denotes a required argument; `[arg]` denotes an optional argument.
- `|` separates alternative values. For example, `[N|all]` accepts a positive integer or `all`.
- `<`, `>`, `[`, and `]` are argument notation and should not be typed as part of the command.

| `/copy [N]`<br>`/copy agent [N\|all]`<br>`/copy user [N\|all]`<br>`/copy all` | — | Copy conversation content to the clipboard. | No argument: copy the most recent agent message (text the agent shows between tool calls counts as a separate message).<br>`N`: the number of recent agent messages to copy; must be a positive integer. `/copy N` is shorthand for `/copy agent N`.<br>`agent [N\|all]`: copy the most recent `N` agent messages or all agent messages. If no count is given, copy the most recent one.<br>`user [N\|all]`: copy the most recent `N` user messages or all user messages. If no count is given, copy the most recent one.<br>`all`: copy the full conversation history. |

## Skill commands

Skills loaded at runtime can be invoked using `/skill-name`. When you submit a skill command, AIxCoding asks the agent to use that skill for the current turn's task.

You can optionally add a task description after the skill name. It is submitted along with the skill command, and the skill's instructions determine how it is handled.

For example, with a skill named `review` loaded:

- `/review`: invoke the skill.
- `/review Check the current changes for potential issues`: invoke the skill and describe the task.

Skill commands are not built-in AIxCoding commands. If a skill has the same name as a built-in command, the built-in command takes precedence.

For instructions on installing and using skills, see [Install and use skills](../guides/extensions/skills.md#use-skills).
