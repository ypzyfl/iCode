# Configure memory

This guide explains how to configure memory for the main agent.

## Prepare memory content

**Memory is added to the system prompt when the main agent loads.** AIxCoding reads the memory files configured for the current main agent and provides their content to the agent as reference material. Memory content uses part of the model's context window and is sent to the model service with requests. Avoid including sensitive information such as secret keys or access tokens in memory.

**Sub-agents do not load memory.** Sub-agents neither inherit the main agent's loaded memory nor load memory from their own agent profiles. Agent nodes in [workflows](../running/workflows.md), however, load the memory configured in their agent profiles.

**Memory is suited to stable, reusable information.** AIxCoding only loads memory files with the `.md` or `.txt` extension. Memory should contain information that can be reused across tasks, such as project conventions, background material, and frequently needed information. Keep it brief, clear, and up to date; instructions for a temporary task are better included directly in the current request.

**The default agents already use AGENTS.md as memory.** The main agents included with AIxCoding, such as Code Agent, load `AGENTS.md` from the working directory. To add general project instructions, start by maintaining this file. If it is not needed, remove its entry from the "Memory" tab.

## Add a memory file

1. Enter `/agents memory` in the input field to open the current agent's "Memory" tab. To configure another main agent, select it from the list on the left.
2. Click "+ Add File" in the "Files" section.
3. Enter a path, or use "Browse" to select a `.md` or `.txt` file. With "Workspace relative" selected, enter a relative path, such as `AGENTS.md` or `docs/context.md`; otherwise, enter an absolute path.

    > **Note:** Relative paths are resolved against the current working directory when memory loads, rather than the directory where the agent profile was created. This lets the same agent load each project's own `AGENTS.md`. Relative paths must stay inside the working directory; use an absolute path for files outside it.
4. Click "Save", then close the agent configuration window.

## Add a memory folder

To load a set of reference files, click "+ Add Folder" in the "Folders" section. With "Workspace relative" selected, enter a relative path; otherwise, enter an absolute path. When finished, click "Save", then close the agent configuration window.

AIxCoding first loads the `.md` and `.txt` files directly in the folder, then scans subfolders one level at a time. For each configured folder, it scans at most two levels of subfolders and loads at most 100 files. If an important file may fall outside these limits, add it separately in the "Files" section.

## Load and reload memory

If the same file is both added individually and discovered in a folder, it is loaded only once. The combined content from all memory sources is limited to 35,000 tokens. Individually added files load first, then folders. Once a file would exceed the limit, that file and all remaining files are skipped, and AIxCoding displays a warning.

After switching working directories or changing the current agent profile, AIxCoding reloads memory using the new paths.

AIxCoding does not monitor loaded memory files for changes. After editing a file directly on disk, reload the main agent for the changes to take effect. For example, restart AIxCoding, switch working directories, modify and save the current agent profile, or switch to another main agent and then switch back.

## Verify that memory is loaded

Enter `/runtime` in the input field, or click the file count at the right end of the status bar above the input field, to open "Runtime Details". Switch to the "Files" tab. This page lists the files actually loaded, grouped by their configured source. If the expected files appear in the list, memory has loaded.

If an expected file is missing, check the following:

* Does the path exist, and does the file have the `.md` or `.txt` extension?
* For a relative path, is the file in the current working directory?
* Does the entry type match the actual path? A file entry must point to a file, and a folder entry to a folder.
* Is there a warning that the content exceeds 35,000 tokens or that some files were skipped?
* Did you click "Save" after changing the configuration?
