# Run AIxCoding in a browser

`aixcoding-cli serve` displays AIxCoding terminal user interface (TUI) in a browser, where you can chat, approve tool calls, and change configuration.

Run `aixcoding-cli serve --help` to view startup options.

This guide calls the device running the browser the “local device” and the machine running AIxCoding service the “server.” The server can be the local device or a remote server accessed over a network.

Before you begin, [install AIxCoding](../../start/getting-started.md#1-install-aixcoding-cli) on the server. The browser provides the interface; AIxCoding uses the server's configuration and reads and modifies files and runs commands with the permissions of the system user who started the service. All these operations take place on the server. All visitors share its configuration, files, and sessions; they do not receive separate accounts.

After your first login, if no model is configured, [configure a model](../../start/getting-started.md#3-configure-a-model) in the browser interface before starting a conversation. Keep the page connected while a task is running. Closing or refreshing the page, or losing the connection, interrupts any task running in that page.

Choose the section that matches the server's location and how you want to access it:

| Scenario | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Run and access AIxCoding locally | [Start AIxCoding locally](#start-aixcoding-cli-locally) |
| Access AIxCoding on a remote server over SSH | [Access remote AIxCoding from your local device](#access-remote-aixcoding-cli-from-your-local-device) |
| Access AIxCoding through a fixed HTTPS domain | [Access AIxCoding through a fixed HTTPS domain](#access-aixcoding-cli-through-a-fixed-https-domain) |

## Start AIxCoding locally

### 1. Start the service

In a terminal on your local device, change to your working directory and start the service:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --auth-required
```

Follow the terminal prompts to enter and confirm a browser login password. The password cannot be empty. `--auth-required` enables password login; without an authentication option, access does not require login.

The service is running when the terminal displays `Serving AIxCoding TUI on ...` and an access URL.

### 2. Log in through the browser

Open `http://localhost:7777` in your local browser and enter the password you set at startup. `localhost` refers to your local device, and `7777` is the service port.

The AIxCoding interface should appear after login, using any existing model configuration on the server. Once a model is configured, send “Hello” and check that you receive a reply.

The directory where you started the service is the initial working directory. Click the directory path at the right end of the conversation area's bottom border to [switch working directories](../daily-use/workspaces.md#change-the-working-directory-during-a-session). `aixcoding-cli serve` does not accept the TUI's `--workdir`, `--agent`, `--model`, or `--session` arguments. Switch agents or models and restore sessions in the page.

### 3. Finish using AIxCoding

Keep the service terminal running while you use AIxCoding. Once your tasks are finished, press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal to stop the service.

Each time you open a page and establish a connection, the server starts a separate AIxCoding instance. Conversation history is saved on the server. After reopening the page, you can [restore a saved session](../daily-use/sessions.md#resume-an-existing-session).

Browser logins remain valid for 12 hours, and you must log in again after the service restarts. Five consecutive incorrect passwords from the same client address lock out that address. Only restarting the service clears the lockout. Restarting disconnects all connected pages.

## Access remote AIxCoding from your local device

If you can already log in to the remote server over SSH, you can create an SSH tunnel to forward your local browser's connection to remote AIxCoding over an encrypted channel, without configuring a domain. The following steps require two terminal windows on your local device.

### 1. Log in to the remote server and start AIxCoding in the first terminal

```shell
ssh <user>@<server>
```

Replace `<user>` with the server's SSH username and `<server>` with its IP address or hostname. Log in using an SSH key or password.

After login, commands in this terminal run on the remote server. Change to the remote working directory, then start AIxCoding:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --auth-required
```

Set a browser login password, confirm that the terminal displays the service URL, and keep the terminal running.

### 2. Create a tunnel in the second terminal

Open a second terminal on your local device and run:

```shell
ssh -N -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 7777:localhost:7777 <user>@<server>
```

Use the same username and server address as in the previous step. After SSH authentication, the terminal usually produces no further output and does not return to the command prompt. Keep it running.

If your SSH login requires a different port or a specific key, add the same connection options to both commands.

### 3. Open AIxCoding in your local browser

Visit `http://localhost:7777` and enter AIxCoding browser login password you set in step 1.

When the browser connects to your local `localhost:7777`, the SSH tunnel forwards the connection to remote AIxCoding. Keep `localhost` in the browser URL for this example; do not replace it with the remote IP address.

When your tasks are finished, press `Ctrl+C` in the first terminal to stop AIxCoding and in the second terminal to close the SSH tunnel.

## Access AIxCoding through a fixed HTTPS domain

To access AIxCoding at a fixed address such as `https://aixcoding-cli.example.com`, deploy a reverse proxy. The browser establishes an encrypted connection to the proxy, which forwards requests to AIxCoding.

This section assumes an existing HTTPS proxy. Configure the domain and certificate on the proxy; AIxCoding itself does not serve HTTPS.

### 1. Start AIxCoding

The following example requires the proxy and AIxCoding to run on the same server. In a terminal on the server, change to your working directory, replace `aixcoding-cli.example.com` with your actual domain, and run:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7777 --public-url https://aixcoding-cli.example.com --auth-required
```

Set a browser login password and keep the terminal running. This command makes AIxCoding accept connections only from the same server. The browser accesses the address specified by `--public-url` through the proxy.

### 2. Configure the proxy connection

The proxy must:

- Forward requests for the domain to `http://127.0.0.1:7777`.
- Preserve the original `Host` header from browser requests so AIxCoding can check the access domain.
- Support WebSocket connections so the page can continuously transmit input and replies.

By default, AIxCoding counts incorrect passwords by proxy address, so multiple visitors may share a failure count. If the proxy is trusted and correctly rewrites `X-Forwarded-For` (the client address request header), add `--auth-trust-forwarded-for` to AIxCoding startup command to count failures by the visitor address supplied by the proxy instead.

### 3. Verify access

Replace `aixcoding-cli.example.com` with your actual domain and open the corresponding HTTPS address in your local browser, such as `https://aixcoding-cli.example.com`. Do not add AIxCoding port `:7777`. The browser should display AIxCoding login page without a certificate warning. After login, send a message and confirm that you receive a reply.

The connection from the browser to the proxy is encrypted; the proxy still connects to AIxCoding over HTTP within the server.

### Other deployment arrangements

If the proxy runs on another server or in a separate container, it may not be able to reach AIxCoding at `127.0.0.1`. After adjusting the listening address, use firewall or container network rules to restrict access to the backend port to trusted proxies, preventing direct connections that bypass the HTTPS proxy. Setting an HTTPS `--public-url` does not encrypt the HTTP connection from the proxy to AIxCoding.

## Read the password from a file or environment variable

When you cannot enter a password interactively in the terminal, provide it through a file or environment variable. Both methods enable authentication automatically, so `--auth-required` is unnecessary. You cannot use both methods at the same time.

### Use a password file

Create a UTF-8 plain text file on the server and write the login password to it. The password cannot be empty; trailing newlines in the file are ignored.

Change to your working directory and start AIxCoding with the password file:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --auth-password-file "<password-file>"
```

Replace `<password-file>` with the path to the password file on the server. Startup no longer prompts for a password. Use the password in the file to log in through the browser.

### Use an environment variable

On the server, set an environment variable for the process that starts AIxCoding, such as `CHRYS_SERVE_PASSWORD`, to a nonempty login password. Then run:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --auth-password-env CHRYS_SERVE_PASSWORD
```

The argument to `--auth-password-env` is the environment variable's name. Startup no longer prompts for a password. Use the variable's value to log in through the browser.

## Access AIxCoding directly through a LAN IP address

Direct access through a LAN IP address transmits login passwords and conversation content in plain text. Use it only in a network environment where you explicitly accept this risk.

On the server, change to your working directory, replace `192.168.1.20` with the server's actual LAN IP address, and run:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --host 0.0.0.0 --public-url http://192.168.1.20:7777 --auth-required --allow-insecure-auth
```

`--host 0.0.0.0` allows other devices to connect to AIxCoding. `--allow-insecure-auth` explicitly allows plain text password login over the network. Without this option, AIxCoding refuses to start in this example.

In your local browser, visit the server's actual LAN IP address, such as `http://192.168.1.20:7777`, and log in. If you cannot connect, check that your local device can reach the server and that the server's firewall allows the client to access TCP port `7777`.

## Troubleshooting

### The `aixcoding-cli` command is not found

Confirm that AIxCoding is installed on the server and that its installation directory is on `PATH`. If you just installed it, reopen the terminal and run this command to verify:

```shell
aixcoding-cli --version
```

### Local startup reports that the port is in use

Specify an available port with `--port` and use the same port in the browser URL. For example, if `8888` is available:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --port 8888 --auth-required
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8888`.

### The SSH tunnel reports that the local port is in use

Change the first port after `-L` to an available local port, keeping the last port set to the port remote AIxCoding is listening on. For example, if remote AIxCoding uses `7777` and local port `8888` is available, run this on your local device:

```shell
ssh -N -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 8888:localhost:7777 <user>@<server>
```

Replace `<user>` and `<server>` with the SSH username and server address. Also restart AIxCoding on the remote server with the new browser access URL:

```shell
aixcoding-cli serve --public-url http://localhost:8888 --auth-required
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8888` on your local device.

### The browser cannot connect

First confirm that AIxCoding service is still running, then check that the browser URL matches your access method: use `localhost` for the local or SSH examples, the configured domain for HTTPS, or the server IP for a direct LAN connection.

If the address is correct but you still cannot connect, check that the SSH tunnel is running for SSH access, or check domain resolution and the proxy service for HTTPS access.

### The HTTPS page shows a certificate warning

Confirm that the browser is using the configured domain. Check whether the proxy certificate has expired, matches the domain, and was issued by an authority the browser trusts.

### The HTTPS page returns `502`

Check that AIxCoding is still running, that the proxy's forwarding address and port match AIxCoding's listening configuration, and that the proxy can reach that address. Consult the proxy logs for the specific cause.

### The page returns `421`

Use the domain or IP address and port displayed when AIxCoding starts. When accessing through a proxy, check that it preserves the original `Host` header.

### The WebSocket connection returns `403`

Check that the browser URL matches the address specified by `--public-url`, including the scheme (`http` or `https`), domain, and port. AIxCoding rejects connections with a mismatched origin.

### Login returns `403`

If the message is `Invalid login token`, reopen the login page and enter the password again. If it is `Invalid login origin`, check that the browser URL matches the access URL configured for AIxCoding.

### Too many password attempts

The client address is locked out. First confirm that no tasks are running in other pages, then press `Ctrl+C` in AIxCoding terminal and restart the service. If multiple visitors using a proxy are locked out at once, check the conditions in the HTTPS section to determine whether enabling `--auth-trust-forwarded-for` is appropriate.

### The previous conversation is missing after a refresh or disconnection

When the page reconnects, the server starts a new AIxCoding instance. Follow the steps for restoring a saved session to restore conversation history, but interrupted tasks do not resume automatically.

### Copying fails

If a copy dialog appears, click **Copy**. If copying still fails, select the text in the dialog and copy it manually using your browser's copy shortcut.
