    rather than ``executor.state.running`` — guarantees that session persistence
    has finished before the caller inspects the store.

    before the new turn has even started.

    A run that outlives ``timeout`` fails the test loudly.  Returning while
    the turn is still active is worse than failing: the caller's next
    ``send_message`` would be consumed as an *injection into the running
    turn* instead of starting a new one, corrupting every downstream
    session/event assertion (the historical silent 5s timeout did exactly
    this on overloaded Windows runners).  The one legitimate "still running"
