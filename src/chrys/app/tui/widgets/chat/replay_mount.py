"""Tail-first replay mounting for the chat transcript.

A restored transcript mounts its newest entries (about three viewports)
before replay returns, so the restore dialog closes as soon as the part the
user sees is ready. A panel-owned task then prepends the older entries above
them, newest batch first, in bounded batches.

Invariants while a prepend runs:

- Pending entries sit, in document order, directly above the oldest mounted
  entry stamped after them, so the transcript is whole at every moment: a
  batch leaves ``pending`` in the same synchronous step that registers it as
  children, and every entry is stamped with its document order before the
  first mount. Entries mounted before the replay (a restore warning) keep
  their place above all replayed history.
- Entries mounted meanwhile (a live turn, another replayed block) are newer
  than all pending ones and append below.
- ``stop`` ends the prepend at a batch boundary and never interrupts a mount;
  only ``abandon`` (panel unmount) cancels the task.
- A prepended batch is a child from the moment it registers, but has no
  geometry until the refresh after it mounted. A TOC jump to a pending turn,
  or to one in such a batch, waits for that refresh; a newer jump, a user
  scroll, ``stop`` or ``abandon`` before then drops it.
- A view that leaves the bottom keeps its content while batches land above
  it, until the last batch has laid out, which can be after the prepend
  ended.
- One GC pause spans the whole replay: a young pass between batches frees
  the cycles each batch left behind, and one full collection ends the pause
  when every entry has mounted.
