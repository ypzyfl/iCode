# Chrys ACP Frontend API

Reference for the ACP surface that non-TUI clients (e.g. the VS Code extension)
use to reach parity with the Textual TUI. Source of truth is the code — keep this
in sync with:

- `src/chrys/app/acp/server.py` — request routing, standard methods, notifications
- `src/chrys/app/acp/session_manager.py` — session/profile/config backend behavior

Related issue: #355.

## Design model

Chrys has one backend runtime (`AgentEngine` + `ChrysSessionHost`) driven by an
internal `EventBus`. Two frontends consume it:

- **TUI** — subscribes to `EventBus` events directly and calls engine/session
  helpers in-process.
- **ACP clients** — speak standard ACP plus a set of Chrys-private extensions.

Goal: a *symmetric frontend contract* — anything the TUI can do, an ACP client can
do through ACP, without reaching into Chrys internals.

Direction principles:

1. ACP clients never call Chrys internals. Missing capability becomes an ACP
   method/event, not a private import.
2. Prefer standard ACP. Only fall back to an extension when ACP has no concept for
   the capability (see *Standard vs. extension* below).
3. Events describe runtime *facts*; each frontend renders them its own way — no
   frontend-specific payload shapes.
4. Some UI stays frontend-native even with a shared backend: editor diff rendering,
   terminal integration, file pickers, notifications, settings UI.
5. Extensions use the `chrys/*`, `session/*`, `sub_agent/*`, `profiles/*`,
   `settings/*`, or `mcp/*` namespaces and are documented here.

## Transport

Standard ACP methods are dispatched by name. Everything Chrys-specific rides on two
ACP escape hatches:

- **`ext_method(method, params)`** — request/response. Client → backend for
  actions/queries; backend → client for `chrys/request_input` (the `ask_user`
  callback). Dispatched by the `method` string in `ChrysAcpServer.ext_method`.
- **`ext_notification(method, params)`** — one-way backend → client push, bridged
  from `EventBus` events in `_handle_chrys_extension_event`.

Param keys are camelCase; most request handlers also accept the legacy
`session_id` spelling. Unknown methods raise JSON-RPC `method_not_found`.

## Standard ACP

Implemented standard methods:

- Lifecycle: `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/load`, `session/list`,
  `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`, `session/close`, and the top-level
  `delete_session`.
- Server → client: `session/request_permission` (approvals), `session/update`
  (agent message/thought chunks, tool calls, `usage_update`, `session_info_update`,
  `current_mode_update`, `plan`). The `plan` update mirrors the builtin todo
  list: streamed live from `TodoListUpdated` events during a turn, and re-seeded
  unconditionally (empty entries = clear) on `session/new`, `session/load`, and
  after `session/rollback` — both to a turn and to welcome.

`session/prompt` takes text, resource links and embedded text resources (sent as
text), and, when the model profile has vision, images. An image needs an `image/*`
`mimeType`, but its bytes name its type; anything but PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP fails
the whole prompt with `invalid_params`. Audio and embedded blob resources fail the same way.

`session/new` and `session/load` accept `additionalDirectories` (advertised via
`SessionCapabilities.additionalDirectories` in `initialize` so clients surface the
option); the manager builds a multi-dir `Workspace` and passes it to
`ChrysSessionHost(workspace=...)`. All `cwd` / `additionalDirectories` paths must be
**absolute** (ACP contract) — a relative path is rejected rather than resolved against
the ACP server's process cwd, which would bind the session to the wrong workspace.
On `session/load` of an inactive session, supplied `additionalDirectories` are
**authoritative** and replace the saved additional roots, with the primary cwd kept
first so an unchanged scope still reuses an OpenAI Responses service session. A
non-empty list narrows/swaps scope; an explicit empty list `[]` clears the saved roots
entirely; omitting the field (`null`/absent) keeps the saved roots. A moved cwd also
drops them. Reloading an already-active session with `additionalDirectories` at all
(any list, including `[]`, or MCP overlays) is rejected — roots can't be rebuilt on a
running host, so the session must be closed first rather than silently keeping the old
scope. `session/list` treats a non-empty `additionalDirectories` list as an exact,
ordered additional-root filter (roots validated absolute like new/load): only
sessions whose saved extra roots match exactly are returned. When omitted or empty,
all sessions for the `cwd` are returned (each session reports its own roots via
`additionalDirectories` in the response).

### Session modes — approval mode (standard)

Approval mode uses ACP's native session-mode mechanism, not an extension:

- `session/new` / `session/load` advertise `modes` (`SessionModeState`):
  available `manual` / `auto` / `bypass` + the current mode.
- `set_session_mode(mode_id, session_id)` switches it.
- Changes are pushed as the standard `current_mode_update` (`session/update`).

The switch is **per-session**: it updates the live approval middleware and does
not write the global settings-document default. Persisting a default approval
mode for future sessions is handled by `session/set_config_option`.

### Session models — model switch (standard, per-session)

Model selection uses ACP's native model mechanism:

- `session/new` / `session/load` advertise `models` (`SessionModelState`):
  available model profiles + the current model id.
- `set_session_model(model_id, session_id)` switches it.

The switch is **per-session**: it swaps `settings.model_profile` in-memory and
soft-restarts the agent (`SetModelProfile` → `on_set_model_profile`) — **no global
settings write**. Credentials come from the `ModelProfile` (read by `create_client`),
not `os.environ`, so two sessions in one process can run different providers
without colliding. `on_settings_reload` preserves the per-session override.
Persisting a *default* model for future sessions is a separate concern handled by
the config surface (`session/set_config_option`).

## Extension RPCs (client → backend)

All routed through `ext_method`.

### Session control

| Method | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `session/delete` | `sessionId`, `cwd?` | Delete a saved session scoped to cwd. |
| `session/inject` | `sessionId`, `text` | Inject a prompt into the active turn. Rejected when no turn is running (use `session/prompt` to start one). |
| `session/rollback` | `sessionId`, `targetTurn`, `revertChanges?`, `selectedPaths?` | Roll back; replays history + emits `chrys/rollback_result`. Response/notification carry `rolledBackUserText` (first discarded user prompt, for restoring the composer), `exclusions` (`[{path, reason}]`, reason = `RollbackExclusionReason` value like `"unrestorable"` / `"move_poisoned"`) for files the plan dropped, and advisory `warnings` (strings). |
| `session/switch_agent` | `sessionId`, `agentProfile` | Switch active agent profile in-session. Unknown profile → immediate error; switching to the active profile is a no-op (no 60s wait) whose response still carries the live runtime (model/tools/skills), so it won't blank client state. |
| `session/set_workspace` | `sessionId`, `primaryCwd` | Change primary workspace cwd. `primaryCwd` is validated strictly (must exist + be a directory, resolved absolutely) like `new`/`load`. Soft-restarts the agent, then pushes `chrys/runtime_update` (skills/MCP/memory/context may change). |
| `session/skip_sleep` | `sessionId`, `callId` | Finish an active `sleep` tool call early. |
| `session/set_config_option` | `sessionId`, `key`, `value` | Persist a supported config key to the user settings document + awaited reload, then push `chrys/runtime_update` (global default; see below). `key` accepts the logical name or its legacy `CHRYS_*` spelling; the response carries all three names (`key` echoed, `envKey`, `settingKey`). The session must be active — it is validated *before* the document write, so a failed request never leaves persisted config mutated. |

Approval mode and model switching are **not** here — they use standard ACP
`set_session_mode` / `set_session_model` (see *Standard ACP*).

### Read-only queries

| Method | Params | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `chrys/session_runtime` | `sessionId` | Runtime snapshot: profile, model, tokens/usage, tools, MCP/skills details. |
| `session/mutations` | `sessionId` | Per-turn mutation summary + rollback turns + file summary. Mutations carry `beforeSkip`/`afterSkip` (`"too_large"` / `"binary"` / `null`) when a side's content backup was withheld by snapshot policy; such files are excluded from the `files` summary. Each mutation also carries `provenance` (`"proven"` / `"assumed"` / `"foreign"`) + `contested` (bool); `turns[].mutations` and `mutationCount` are the **raw event log** (foreign rows included — clients filter/badge themselves), while the net-level `files` list excludes foreign changes and carries folded `contested`/`inferred` badges. |
| `session/diff` | `sessionId`, `path?`, `turn?` | Before/after text diff entries (binary-aware). Entries whose content backup was withheld by snapshot policy (oversized/binary files) are omitted. Each entry carries the same folded `contested`/`inferred` badges as the `session/mutations` `files` list, so clients can badge diffs without joining the two endpoints. |
| `session/history` | `sessionId`, `cwd?` | Raw persisted messages, without the messages compaction excluded (tool calls it summarized or removed, a dropped current turn's in-between text, folded turns). Scoped to the requesting workspace cwd (like `load`/`delete`); a session from another workspace is rejected. An assistant message whose `additional_properties._group` has `_summary_of_group_ids` is compaction's summary of excluded tool calls, kept for the model: the `session/load` and `session/rollback` replays show neither the summary nor the messages it replaced, and a client rendering this list should skip it too. |
| `settings/options` | `sessionId?` | Supported config keys under all three names (`key`, `envKey`, `settingKey`). Each entry carries the durable document `value` plus `baseValue`/`baseSource` — the manager's base settings, deliberately not called any session's view. With `sessionId`, entries add `sessionValue`/`sessionSource` read from that session's own loaded settings. |
| `mcp/list` | `sessionId` | MCP tools + failures from runtime details. |
| `skills/list` | `sessionId` | Skill sources + details from runtime details. |

### Sub-agent control

| Method | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `sub_agent/retry` | `sessionId`, `invocationId` | Retry a paused sub-agent invocation. |
| `sub_agent/abort` | `sessionId`, `invocationId` | Abort a paused sub-agent invocation. |

### Profiles / config / MCP

| Method | Params | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles/agents/list` | — | Agent profile summaries, including a `builtin` flag. |
| `profiles/agents/read` | `name` | Full agent profile. **MCP `headers`/`env` values masked as `"***"`.** |
| `profiles/agents/write` | `profile` | Persist. Masked `"***"` MCP secrets restored from the stored profile. |
| `profiles/agents/delete` | `name` | Delete a user agent profile. Built-in profiles are rejected; clients should migrate the previous "delete shadow to restore built-in" behavior to `profiles/agents/reset`. |
| `profiles/agents/reset` | `name` | Reset a built-in profile while retaining Skills, MCP, and Memory settings. Returns `changed: false` when no shadow or resettable changes exist. |
| `profiles/models/list` | — | Model profile summaries (no secrets). |
| `profiles/models/read` | `id` | Full model profile. **`api_key` masked as `"***"`.** |
| `profiles/models/write` | `profile` | Persist. `api_key` of `""`/`"***"` preserves the stored key. Omitting `stream` or sending `null` streams for a new profile and keeps the stored value on an update; `false` (or another false spelling such as `0` or `""`) turns streaming off. |
| `profiles/models/delete` | `id` | Delete a model profile. |
| `settings/reload` | `sessionId` | Reload registries + soft-restart. Awaits the rebuild: a failed reload returns an error, success pushes `chrys/runtime_update`. |
| `mcp/test` | `server` | One-shot HTTP MCP connection test. Client-supplied stdio is rejected. |

### Backend → client callback

`chrys/request_input` carries the whole `ask_user` batch in one request:
`sessionId`, `requestId`, `callerName`, and `questions`:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "…",
  "requestId": "…",
  "callerName": "Code",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which library?",
      "header": "Library",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": [{"label": "tenacity", "description": "Use the existing dependency."}]
    },
    {
      "question": "Anything else the retry layer must respect?",
      "header": "Constraints",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": []
    }
  ]
}
```

A receiver rejects unknown fields, wrong nested types, over-cap payloads, and
malformed metadata. There is no capability negotiation and no single-question
projection: every peer speaks this shape.

The client returns a fixed-length positional `answers` array:

```json
{
  "answers": [
    {"values": ["tenacity"], "note": "only for the retry layer"},
    {"values": ["Keep the retry layer transport-agnostic."], "note": ""}
  ],
  "cancelled": false
}
```

Free text is a value, not a note: a question without options (or one the user
answered by typing instead of choosing) carries the typed text as the single
entry of `values`. `note` is only accepted alongside selected option labels, so
a note-only answer invalidates the whole response. An empty `values` means the
question was left unanswered; the model sees it as `unanswered: true`.

Structured responses are accepted atomically. The answer count must match the
question count; values must be distinct and non-blank; a non-multi-select
question accepts at most one value; multiple values must all be offered option
labels; and a note is valid only with canonical selected options. Every string
in the request and the response must be valid Unicode (no unpaired surrogate
escapes), matching what the JSON transport accepts. A malformed `answers`
array, `cancelled: true`, a response without `answers`, or a failed callback
all mean no response; the model receives the retryable `ask_user_no_response`
tool error. There is no fabricated answer-text sentinel.

`ask_user` waits for the client reply with **no backend timeout** by default under
ACP (`chrys acp` sets `ask_user_timeout_seconds=None`), so the client owns the
interaction lifetime — keep the prompt open until the user answers, or send
`session/cancel` to abandon the turn. Pass `chrys acp --ask-user-timeout SECONDS`
to opt into a backend bound instead; on expiry the model receives a "user did not
respond" result and the question is considered closed. The timeout is a
per-session `Settings.ask_user_timeout_seconds` value (TUI/CLI default to a bounded
15 minutes via `CHRYS_ASK_USER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`). Under ACP this value is *pinned*:
`settings/reload` keeps the client-owned timeout rather than reverting to the env
default (TUI/CLI sessions are unpinned, so they pick up an edited
`CHRYS_ASK_USER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` on reload).

Standard `session/request_permission` callbacks have a separate 10-minute
server-side liveness bound. `session/cancel`, `session/close`, and
`session/delete` interrupt the engine first and then release pending input and
permission callbacks; close and delete additionally stop prompt admission
before releasing waits, so a prompt already queued on the session is rejected
rather than started as a fresh turn the teardown would wait behind. Late
permission replies are ignored, and unrelated sessions remain independently
promptable while one client callback is pending.

## Extension notifications (backend → client)

One-way `ext_notification` pushes, bridged from `EventBus`:

- Runtime / session: `chrys/runtime_update`, `chrys/session_restored`,
  `chrys/usage_update`, `chrys/profile_switched`, `chrys/workspace_updated`,
  `chrys/approval_reviewed`.
- Agent load lifecycle: `chrys/agent_load_started`, `chrys/agent_load_progress`,
  `chrys/agent_load_finished`, `chrys/agent_load_failed`.
- Diagnostics: `chrys/error`, `chrys/warning`, `chrys/context_compressed`,
  `chrys/context_pressure`, `chrys/tool_compacted`,
  `chrys/compaction_started`, `chrys/compaction_finished`.
- Edits / turns: `chrys/rollback_result`, `chrys/user_inject_result`.
- Sub-agent lifecycle: `chrys/sub_agent_invocation_start`,
  `chrys/sub_agent_tool_call_start`, `chrys/sub_agent_tool_call_result`,
  `chrys/sub_agent_progress`, `chrys/sub_agent_retry_attempt`,
  `chrys/sub_agent_compaction_started`, `chrys/sub_agent_compaction_finished`,
  `chrys/sub_agent_compaction_committed`,
  `chrys/sub_agent_paused`, `chrys/sub_agent_resumed`,
  `chrys/sub_agent_aborted`, `chrys/sub_agent_cascade_aborted`.

Notes:
- `chrys/runtime_update` always uses the envelope `{ sessionId, runtime: {...} }`
  for every sender (`session/new`/`load`, model switch, settings reload,
  `set_config_option`, `set_workspace`, rollback, `SessionReady`,
  `AgentRuntimeUpdated` — including mid-turn runtime-skill refreshes). The
  `runtime` object may be partial. The
  `chrys/session_runtime` *request* returns that same runtime object flat (a
  separate request/response contract).
- `chrys/usage_update` is dual-path for parent-agent session-window updates —
  emitted as a notification *and* projected through the standard
  `session/update` bridge. Sub-agent usage updates are extension-only so
  standard ACP clients do not replace the parent session-window gauge with a
  sub-agent window.
  Its extension payload includes `agentProfile` for display and `usageSourceId`
  for identity, so clients can distinguish parent-agent usage from concurrent
  same-profile sub-agent usage.
- Sub-agent events are dual-path too: each `chrys/sub_agent_*` notification is
  emitted *and* the bridge projects standard `session/update` tool-call progress
  onto the parent sub-agent tool call, so standard-only clients still see progress.
- `chrys/compaction_finished` and `chrys/sub_agent_compaction_finished`
  payloads include `formatViolation`. It is empty unless a malformed
  LAST_WORDS note was accepted, in which case it carries the bounded,
  single-line violation left when the corrective retry process stops. The
  parent event also carries a successful generated note in `lastWords`;
  sub-agent notes remain private to their invocation.
- Both `*_compaction_finished` payloads also include `failureReason` — a
  short human-readable cause set on `failed` outcomes tripped by a known
  safety limit (per-turn compaction round limit, side-call spend budget).
  Frontends should show it in place of the duration on the failure state;
  it is empty for ordinary generation failures.
- `chrys/sub_agent_compaction_committed` (payload `{ sessionId, agentName,
  invocationId, compactionId, phase }`) trails a `finished` `ok` outcome for
  the same `compactionId` once the round is durably applied — spill written,
  note set, messages excluded. A `finished(ok)` round without it was
  abandoned (its spill write failed), so clients that count or persist real
  compactions must key on this notification, not on `finished`. It is
  extension-only: the standard bridge stays silent because the finished
  update already narrated the outcome.
- Approval-mode changes use the standard `current_mode_update` `session/update`,
  not an extension.

## Standard vs. extension

Capabilities that map cleanly to ACP semantics use standard methods; the rest are
extensions because ACP has no equivalent concept.

**Standard (already migrated):** approval mode (`set_session_mode` + session
modes), model switch (`set_session_model` + session models).

**Extension by necessity (no ACP concept):** rollback, mutations/diff, sub-agent
hierarchy + retry/abort, runtime details (tools/MCP/skills introspection), agent
profile CRUD, `mcp/test`, mid-run injection, agent-load progress, context/tool
compaction, structured errors/warnings.

### Why config options stay an extension

ACP has a native config mechanism (`config_options` on `session/new`,
`set_config_option`, `current_config_option_update`). Chrys deliberately does
**not** use it for its config keys, because the semantics don't match:

- **Scope.** ACP `set_config_option` is *per-session*; Chrys's keys (the
  `AcpConfigOption` descriptors in `_SUPPORTED_CONFIG_OPTIONS`) write the global
  user settings document. A per-session advertisement of a global value would lie
  about scope and bleed across sessions.
- **Lifecycle.** The settings-document write persists to disk and is shared with
  the TUI and future processes. ACP config options have no "global application
  setting" concept.
- **Defaults vs. live state.** Keys like `default_agent` / `default_approval_mode`
  are defaults for the *next* session, not live controls for the current one.
  `default_approval_mode=bypass` is downgraded to `auto` by the settings store's
  own `persist` so a later launch never starts in unattended approval.
- **Type.** ACP config options are `select` / `boolean` only;
  `rollback_snapshots_keep` is an integer and several keys are free identifiers.
  Values are judged by the same coercer that will read them back, *before* the
  document write (a non-integer `rollback_snapshots_keep` is rejected), so an
  unparseable value can't persist and break a later launch/reload.

So the config extension is intentionally the home for *global, persisted
application defaults*.

## Security notes

- **No config-key injection.** Config values land in the YAML settings document,
  which stores them verbatim — there is no line-oriented format for a newline to
  smuggle a second key into. With the `_SUPPORTED_CONFIG_OPTIONS` allowlist, a
  client cannot write arbitrary settings keys.
- **Secret masking.** `read_model_profile` masks `api_key`; `read_agent_profile`
  masks MCP `headers`/`env` values. Write paths restore masked sentinels from the
  stored profile so a read → edit → write round-trip never destroys secrets, and
  reject unresolved masked MCP values after server rename/add.
- **Profile path safety.** Agent profile names and model profile ids accepted over
  ACP must be filename-safe stems, not absolute or relative paths.
- **No client stdio execution.** `mcp/test` accepts HTTP MCP configs only and keeps
  client-supplied HTTP headers literal; stdio MCP execution remains limited to
  trusted profile configuration.

## Gaps vs. the full ACP protocol

Standard ACP methods Chrys does **not** implement:

- `authenticate` — Chrys advertises `auth=None`.
- `fork_session` / `resume_session` — defer or implement as standard (not ext).
- `set_config_option` (standard typed config) — intentionally replaced by the
  global config extension (see *Why config options stay an extension*).

Standard client capabilities Chrys does **not** use (server → client):

- `read_text_file` / `write_text_file` — editor-mediated file I/O. Chrys writes
  files directly and surfaces changes via `session/diff` + `session/mutations`.
- Terminal suite (`create_terminal`, `terminal_output`, `release_terminal`,
  `wait_for_terminal_exit`, `kill_terminal`) — no shell/terminal delegation yet.

Standard `session/update` variants Chrys does **not** emit:
`available_commands_update`, `current_config_option_update`.

## Remaining feature gaps / TODO

Priority: P1 = high-value VS Code UX, P2 = can stay TUI-only for now.

- **[P1] Session-level retry/continue.** `UserRetry` / `RetryAttempt` not exposed
  (only sub-agent retry is). Needs a `session/retry` RPC + `chrys/retry_attempt`.
- **[P1] Approval-judge detail depth.** `chrys/approval_reviewed` carries the final
  decision; pending/intermediate judge metadata is not surfaced.
- **[P1] Richer CRUD validation.** Profile/MCP write/delete is functional, but
  field-level validation feedback and a config-dir MCP overlay beyond
  session-create are still thin.
- **[P2] Image attachment compression events**
  (`ImageAttachmentCompressionStarted/Finished`).
- **[P2] Shell mode / terminal delegation** — use ACP's standard terminal client
  methods rather than a new extension.
- **[P2] Queryable backend logs** (`session/logs` / `runtime/logs`).
- **[P2] Session fork/resume** — use standard `fork_session` / `resume_session`.
- **[P2] Editor file mediation** — adopt standard `read_text_file` /
  `write_text_file` so VS Code can mediate edits (unsaved buffers).
- **[P2] Session raw/debug read**, gated to local clients.
- **Out of scope by design:** notifications config, theme, and the Buddy
  surface remain frontend-local cosmetic UX, not shared backend capabilities.

### Capability discovery (known limitation)

Extension methods are not advertised in `initialize` capabilities or versioned —
clients must know the `chrys/*` / `session/*` method names by convention; unknown
methods raise `method_not_found`. A future improvement is to advertise the
extension surface (and its version) during `initialize`.

## Suggested implementation order

1. Session-level retry/continue (matches TUI interaction model).
2. Approval-judge detail surfacing (trust/diagnosis).
3. CRUD validation + MCP overlay hardening.
4. Capability discovery during `initialize`.
5. Lower-priority P2 items as VS Code UX demands.
