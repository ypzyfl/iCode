"""Check that the directory a command was launched from still exists.

A shell can keep a directory as its cwd after it was deleted or moved. Every
entry point resolves its workspace, ``.env`` and project settings against that
directory, so each one checks it once after parsing its arguments (and after
``-C`` changed into another directory), and stops with one clear line instead
of a traceback from deep inside startup.
