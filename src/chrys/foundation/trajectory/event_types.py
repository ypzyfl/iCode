"""Catalog of trajectory event types and closed enumerations.

Readers skip (and count) event types outside :data:`KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES`. A value
outside one of the enumerations below is never a reason to drop an event: it is
decoded and handed on as written, and a consumer that groups by it shows it as
``unknown`` rather than losing the row. Reason / error / failure fields carry
these codes only — never free text.
