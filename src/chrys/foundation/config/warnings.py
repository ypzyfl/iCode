"""Turning a rejected setting into something the user actually sees.

Separate from the loader because the loader must stay a pure function of its
sources: whether a rejected value is worth interrupting someone over depends on
which frontend is running, and only the caller knows that.

Separate from any one entrypoint because every entrypoint had been dropping
them. ``LoadedSettings`` carried the warnings and each root kept only
``.settings``, so a value the user had written simply had no effect and said
nothing about why.

One catalog entry per reason rather than a shell with a ``{detail}`` slot: a
message argument is a scalar, so a detail composed anywhere but here arrives as
finished English and lands untranslated in the middle of a translated
sentence. Whole sentences are also what a translator can actually work with.
