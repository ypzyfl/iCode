"""The one place settings are assembled from their sources.

``Settings`` is a plain value object; this module is what turns the layered
sources into one: the user document, the dotenv files beside it, the process
environment as it stood before bootstrap, the project trust domain under the
caller's ``project_root``, and the pins a frontend passes in.

The load runs in two phases. Phase one reads every file whole and audits the
project layers completely — policy filter, per-key coercion, tighten/loosen
verdicts — whether or not anything above will shadow them, because a rejected
project value must warn even when it would have lost anyway. Phase two picks
each key's winner from the highest layer down; it is the only phase
``InvalidPolicy.SAFE_DEFAULT`` terminates. The non-project layers keep their
established warning scope (a layer below the winner stays unexamined), so
effective values and existing warnings are unchanged by the split.

Callers get three things back and are expected to keep all of them: the
settings, where each value came from, and what was rejected on the way. A
caller that only wants the settings can say so with ``.settings``, but it
cannot pretend the other two do not exist — that is how the panel ends up
unable to explain why the value a user just typed has no effect.

    They are also the one layer that reaches ``Settings`` without passing a
    coercer, which is why the check has to be made here rather than trusted:
    ``tools.result.ceiling_tokens`` declares ``SAFE_DEFAULT`` precisely so a bad
    value cannot uncap the backstop, and a pinned ``-1`` would do exactly that,
    because the consumer reads any non-positive ceiling as "no ceiling".

    Two checks, because neither alone is enough. :func:`kind_accepts` answers
    the type question a coercer cannot (``None`` and ``""`` are real values for
    the fields that declare them, not blanks to be dropped); the coercer answers
    the domain question a type cannot. A value the coercer has nothing to say
    about — those spellings, which come back ``MISSING`` — is taken verbatim.

    ``Kind.ENUM`` is the exception, because it is the one kind whose domain is
    written down in full: ``choices`` *is* the domain, so a value outside it is
    outside the domain by construction, and there is no unset spelling left over
    to mean anything. Everywhere else the blank carries meaning the coercer
    cannot see — ``model_profile=""`` is "no pinned profile", and ACP's
    ``ask_user_timeout_seconds=None`` is "no timeout, the client owns timing" —
    so those stay verbatim. Without the exception a blank sails past the
    canonical check below and lands in ``Settings`` as a value no ``choices``
    list contains, and, because a rejected value is what seals a dangerous key,
    it takes the seal with it: pinning ``default_approval_mode=""`` over an
    ``ENV`` value that failed its coercer leaves the key holding ``""``,
    unsealed, credited to the pin.
