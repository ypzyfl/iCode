"""Environment source separation: the frozen process snapshot and dotenv layers.

Before this module, ``load_dotenv(override=True)`` folded both dotenv files
into ``os.environ`` and the origin of every value was lost — provenance could
not be trusted, and "the real shell environment wins" could not be enforced.
The separation rests on three rules:

* Only the **real process environment** is frozen, once, before bootstrap
  injects anything. Dotenv files are re-read on every load so external edits
  take effect on the next reload, and so one process can serve several roots.
* Chrys's own keys are **never injected** into ``os.environ`` from dotenv
  files — settings keys travel through the settings layers, the model-profile
  pointer through its registry, and IPC keys only through the real
  environment or an explicit subprocess overlay.
* Whether a name *is* one of Chrys's keys has exactly one implementation,
  :func:`canonical_env_name` + :func:`classify_env_name`, and it is
  case-insensitive on Windows because ``os.environ`` is.
