"""The settings that are fixed for the life of the process.

A handful of settings are consumed by code that has no engine, no session and
no ``Settings`` in reach: an import-time module constant, a probe cached behind
a process lock, a TUI helper called from a widget. They read ``os.environ``
directly today, which works only because bootstrap injects every ``CHRYS_*``
into it. Once the dotenv layers stop being injected, those readers go blind —
so they need a source that is neither the environment nor a per-session object.

That source is this module: one snapshot, written once by the entrypoint
bootstrap, read by everyone else. It carries **only** fields declared
``Apply.RESTART``, which is the same statement from the other side — a value
that a restart is required to change is exactly a value a process snapshot can
hold honestly. Nothing here may be a ``RELOAD`` or ``LIVE`` field: those change
under a live process, and a reader that took them from here would silently keep
a stale value forever.

Until bootstrap installs a snapshot, reads fall back to a fresh load. Tests and
tooling that never bootstrap therefore keep seeing what they configure, and
production is unaffected because every entrypoint bootstraps before any of
these readers can run.
