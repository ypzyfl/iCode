"""Model/tool loop over a chat middleware layer and a provider wire client.

``ToolLoopLayer`` owns per-run middleware pipelines, dispatch, result assembly,
continuation state and interrupt-recovery recording. Each ``get_response``
builds one ``_LoopRun`` (the blocking and streaming drivers) over a
``_WireCaller`` (logical model calls and their wire retry lanes) and a
``_LoopTrajectory`` (cycle, exchange and retry events, and the landed tool
operations not yet dispatched). Tool calls execute in ``_tool_execution``;
the interrupt-recovery journal is ``_loop_recorder``.

Tool containers become fresh run-local lists, since direct callers and
progressive exposure can add tools after agent preparation. Inner stream
result hooks run once; final assembly must not replay them.

Kernel dependencies stay within this package, allowed third-party packages
and foundation. Intra-package imports are relative.

    This loop is the single authoritative producer of ``_chrys_tool_invocation_order``.
    Landing happens at response arrival — before recording, dispatch
    extraction, tool lookup, and argument validation — over every
    non-informational ``function_call`` content in model emission order.
    Calls the dispatch filter drops (already-answered, duplicate ids,
    no-tools batches) and calls that fail pre-pipeline validation still
    consume ordinals, so persisted numbering can never diverge from pipeline
    numbering. Tool-operation ids are assigned later, once response-scoped
    pairing has distinguished work this loop owns from calls the provider
    already answered. Returns the next unassigned ordinal.

    Sole-authority consequences: a pre-existing stamp on a content this run
    has NOT numbered is foreign data (a bridged or cached response replaying
    another run's history) and is overwritten — preserving it while the
    counter advances would let a stale value collide with a fresh assignment.

    ``echo_registry`` holds the identity of every content the conversation
    already holds — the loop seeds it from caller history and response
    contents land here, batch results register in
    ``_handle_function_call_results``; usage stays out via the registry's
    ``ignore_usage`` construction policy. A content OBJECT reappearing
    later (a client echoing prior messages back, or the same object
    repeated within one response) is an echo of history, not new work, and
    is removed before the recorder, the dispatch filter, and final
    transcript assembly observe it: an echoed call would otherwise
    re-execute or persist as a dangling duplicate, and an echoed result
    would duplicate an answer the transcript already holds. Removal is by
    object identity only — a DIFFERENT content reusing an echoed call id
    is fresh work (providers mint per-response counter ids) and lands
    normally; a dead member's recycled address can never match, because
    membership requires the registered object itself to still be alive.
    Identity removal presumes assembly cannot launder an echoed object into
    a new one: ``ChatResponseUpdate`` assembly MERGES consecutive same-call
    function-call fragments (and coalesces adjacent text) into NEW objects,
    so the streaming loop registers ``_strip_echoed_update`` as a per-turn
    update filter on the wire stream — conversation-held objects are
    removed at the innermost stream BEFORE accumulation, so a merge copy of
    an echo never exists, a fresh call reusing an echoed id assembles alone
    with its own arguments, and the provider finalizer plus every result
    hook observe the same echo-free sequence (no re-assembly ever
    overwrites a hook's rewrite of the response). Call-id-level provenance
    cannot do this job: an id carrying both a laundered echo merge and a
    fresh call is ambiguous per id, and either verdict misfires
    (re-executing the echo or swallowing the fresh call via duplicate-id
    dispatch). The reverse direction of the same laundering is covered by
    ``_record_stream_fragment_identities`` after landing: merges mint NEW
    assembled objects, so the raw fragments a client just streamed would
    otherwise stay unknown to the memo and could be replayed next turn.

    Message wrappers are never shared with the client, in either direction.
    Every retained message is REPLACED in ``response.messages`` by a
    loop-owned shallow copy (own contents list, copied
    ``additional_properties``) — or dropped when nothing fresh remains.
    That isolation cuts both ways: echo removal never mutates the incoming
    message (the same object may sit in the accumulated transcript, and a
    client-held alias must keep its view), and a stateful client that later
    mutates a message object it returned — appending a fresh call between
    iterations — cannot rewrite the history this run already landed.
    The request direction is covered too: ``_WireCaller._call`` sends EVERY
    outgoing message — caller history included — as a per-call view
    (``_wire_message_view``), so mutating an INPUT message can corrupt
    neither landed history nor the caller's session-state objects; message
    metadata still writes through because views share the wrapper's
    ``additional_properties`` dict. ``messages`` is rebound, not mutated,
    so caller-held aliases of the original list keep their view. The
    CONTENT objects stay the originals: the registry references them
    weakly, so an entry lives exactly as long as its object and a
    collected content simply stops being a member.

    Landing is also where the trajectory identities are minted, under the
    same sole-authority rule as the ordinal: every retained message gets a
    fresh analytics item id and is bound to ``exchange_operation_id`` (the
    wire exchange that produced it); every fresh function call gets its own
    item id. A pre-existing operation stamp is foreign data (a replayed or
    cached response) and is removed, never trusted. The dispatch collector
    later assigns one operation id per unresolved call id; duplicate call
    contents share it, while a provider-answered call has no Chrys tool
    operation to name.

    they are the SELECTED attempt's replay, so failed attempts' fragments
    are not recorded and can be legitimately re-sent on a retry.

    Must run AFTER ``_land_response_contents``: a single-fragment call's
    assembled content IS the fragment object, and pre-registering it
    would make landing drop the fresh call as its own echo.

    No retention side: a replay requires the client to still HOLD the
    fragment, which keeps the weak entry alive; a collected fragment's
    entry evicts, so its recycled id can never strip a genuinely fresh
    content. Usage is request-scoped accounting rather than conversation
    content (a client may reuse a mutable usage object across model
    calls), so the registry's ``ignore_usage`` policy keeps it out.

    """The loop's logical model calls and their wire retry lanes.

    A logical call is one ``blocking_response`` or ``streaming_response``:
    every request it sends until a response lands — continuation polls,
    transient and stall retries, the stall fallback to a blocking request
    and one context-overflow resend. Retries need a wire policy, which a
    service-side run never gets.

    State, by lifetime: the continuation token last mirrored to the retry
    owner lives for the run; the overflow-resend flag for one logical call
    (the stall fallback inherits it); the transient and stall counters for
    one ``blocking_response`` call or the streaming attempts of one
    ``streaming_response``, so the stall fallback's blocking request starts
    a fresh transient budget; the provider stream and its usage chunks for
    one request. Of the run's options, only ``continuation_token`` is
    written here.

    """One ``ToolLoopLayer.get_response`` run: the two loop drivers and the steps they share.

    ``run_blocking`` and ``stream`` (assembled by ``finalize_stream``) drive
    the same iterations: send the prepped messages, land the response, close
    its cycle, run the landed calls as one batch and queue the next request —
    until no local call is left, or the iteration budget runs out and a final
    request without tools ends the run. They differ in how usage is counted
    and how a terminating batch ends the run; the streaming driver also
    yields between steps and withholds service-side handles ahead of the
    yields a consumer may stop at. Every step the two drive identically is a
    method here.

    The run's transcript state — echo registry, prepped and accumulated loop
    messages, tool ordinal, error and call counters, aggregated usage — lives
    for the run; the caller's history is read when a driver starts. Only the
    streaming driver writes ``_latest_usage``, ``_final_messages`` and
    ``_service_state_invalidated``, which ``finalize_stream`` reads, and
    ``_reading``, which ``close_abandoned_read`` reads and clears.

    Writes outside the run: ``tool_choice`` in the run's options, and
    ``tools`` through each tool batch (normalized per batch, so the next
    request offers the live list); the recorder's journal (landed responses,
    staged exchanges and their sealed results); the injection probe's drain;
    continuation state in the client kwargs, options and session through
    ``_update_continuation_state`` and ``_invalidate_service_continuation_state``;
    and the streaming driver's two session pre-clears. ``_WireCaller`` writes
    the options' ``continuation_token``.
