"""Workflow run admission and routing for one engine.

A ``WorkflowRunRequest`` is answered exactly once, with ``WorkflowRunAccepted``
or ``WorkflowRunRejected``; a repeated ``request_id`` gets the same answer
again and starts nothing. Admission reserves the execution lease first (one
workflow run globally, never beside a live turn), then resolves the file,
checks its confirmed bytes before probing its interpreter, checks the prepared
environment, loads it on a fresh worker, checks the caller's expected digests
and the full confirmation record, admits the manifest against
the registries, and opens the run record. Only then is the request accepted
and the runner started. Every rejection along the way releases the lease
and closes the worker.
