"""What a wire client reports about each request it sends.

A :class:`WireCallObserver` belongs to one wire client and sees every request
that client sends (one *acquisition*). For each acquisition it:

- reports the request as one exchange of the active trajectory trace
  (:class:`ExchangeRecorder`): the start marker before the request leaves,
  the finish marker once the response lands;
- stamps the measured response span on the landed messages and on the
  provider-hosted contents the provider newly produced, leaving any message
  or content the provider echoed from the request untouched; a continued or
  polled background response therefore records the latency of its last poll
  alone;
- hands the text the model wrote beside its tool calls to the intermediate-text
  callback before the tool loop sees the response, so the UI can show it ahead
  of the tool calls. Non-streaming responses go to the async callback, awaited
  before the response is returned; streams go to the sync callback from a
  result hook, which runs when the stream finalizes and before the tool loop
  inspects the response. The streaming callback typically stores the text in
  an ``IntermediateTextBuffer`` that is released before the next
  ``ToolCallStart`` (or, for a call that starts no tool, the next response or
  the pass end).

Internal side calls (the LAST_WORDS completer, below ``get_response``) never
join the conversation: they keep their exchange report but get neither timing
nor intermediate text.
