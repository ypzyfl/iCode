"""The Messages API client: one request out, one message or event stream back.

It runs over a configured Anthropic SDK client (direct, Bedrock, Foundry or
Vertex) and owns closing it. :mod:`.request` builds the request,
:mod:`.decode` and :mod:`.stream` read the answer.

When the service refuses replayed thinking as bound to a different
conversation, the client resends the request once without it, unless the
request asked for that refusal; see :meth:`AnthropicMessagesClient._create`.
