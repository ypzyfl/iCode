"""Streamed chunks read back as chat response updates.

Tool calls arrive in fragments keyed by an index and, usually, an id. One
:class:`StreamState` per stream assembles them per choice and releases each
call once, whole, in an update of its own just before the update that
finishes its choice, or at the end of a stream no chunk finished. The kernel
never sees a fragment.

Some gateways end a stream without a finish reason. Its calls are released
only when every one of them has arguments a model could have finished. A
stream that refused or was filtered fails instead of handing over calls,
also when the refusal comes after calls it already released: the response
lands only after the stream ends, so its calls never run.

A choice finishes once: a finish reason that follows on it counts only when
it reports the content filter, which still refuses the calls released. A
stream has said how it ends once every choice finished or it settled on a
failure (:attr:`StreamState.ended`): the client reads what follows up to its
usage, waiting a short bound for anything that adds to the answer, for the
usage and for a refusal or failure it still reports.
