"""The Chat Completions clients: one request out, one completion or chunk stream back.

They run over a configured ``AsyncOpenAI`` client and own closing it.
:mod:`.request` builds the request, :mod:`.decode` and :mod:`.stream` read
the answer. OpenAI-compatible endpoints differ only in what a
:class:`ChatCompletionsVariant` describes, so the DeepSeek and GLM clients
are the same client with another variant.
