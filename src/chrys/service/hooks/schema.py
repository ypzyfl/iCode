"""Dataclass schema for the on-disk hooks config.

      shutdown_grace_seconds: 5
      max_parallel_hooks: 4
    hooks:
      - id: ...

YAML and JSON parse to the same intermediate dict; loaders in
:mod:`chrys.service.hooks.loader` convert that dict into these dataclasses and
validate combinations (e.g. ``mode: blocking`` + ``detach: true`` is
rejected at load time).

These classes are deliberately validation-only: they carry no runtime
behaviour.  :mod:`chrys.service.hooks.runner` and :mod:`chrys.service.hooks.manager`
operate on instances.
