"""Durable outbox for ``delivery: durable`` hooks.

Job lifecycle::

    pending/{job_id}.json   ← written before subprocess spawn
       │  (subprocess runs)
       ├─→  done/{job_id}.json    on exit_code == 0
       └─→  failed/{job_id}.json  on non-zero / timeout

Each job file carries the hook id, event payload, retry count, and
timestamps.  On chrys startup the manager scans ``pending/`` and
re-spawns any entry older than ``HookSettings.outbox_retry_age_seconds``
that hasn't exceeded ``outbox_max_retries``.  Entries that exceed the
cap move directly to ``failed/`` with no retry — the user is expected
to inspect them, fix the hook, and either delete the file or move it
back manually.

Semantics are at-least-once.  Hooks marked ``delivery: durable`` must
be idempotent — if chrys crashes after the subprocess exits 0 but
before the move-to-done renames, the next startup will re-run the
hook.  This matches every "outbox pattern" I've seen and is the
trade-off for not requiring a daemon.
