"""Shell execution tools — instance-based tools that hold SessionEnvironment.

Uses Chrys kernel instance tool support: @tool on class methods binds to the
instance via the descriptor protocol, giving each tool access to self._runtime
for working directory, platform info, etc.

On Unix, commands run with stdout/stderr attached to a PTY and
``TERM=dumb`` so programs see terminal output streams but suppress most ANSI
formatting.  Stdin is ``/dev/null`` and the PTY is not installed as a
controlling terminal, so interactive terminal reads fail instead of triggering
job-control stops.  On Windows, commands run with stdout/stderr pipes (no PTY
available).

Each output stream is captured within a byte limit that keeps its head and
tail (``foundation/platform/output_capture.py``), and the result is truncated
to ``max_tokens`` with a 1:2 head:tail ratio.  Every backend first assembles
the same canonical result shape; when a session directory is available, the
cleaned result is spilled there before the bounded view is returned.
