"""Response validators for :class:`ResponseValidationMiddleware`.

Defines a small protocol + a regex-driven default validator that detects
common LLM / inference-service misbehaviours that would otherwise cause
the agent loop to terminate with a nonsense final response:

1. **Empty contents** — the final assistant message has ``contents == []``.
2. **Whitespace-only text** — the final assistant message has text content
   but every text item is empty or whitespace (``""``, ``"\\n\\n\\n"``, etc.),
   AND there are no tool calls in the same message.  (A tool-calling turn
   with no text is perfectly valid and NOT flagged.)
3. **Leaked tool-call markers in text** — provider/model leaked the raw
   tool-call tokens into the text channel instead of emitting them as
   ``function_call`` content.  Covers ``minimax:tool_call`` (MiniMax via
   vLLM), ``<tool_use>``, ``<function_call>``, ``<|tool_call|>`` and
   variations.  Text before or after the marker still triggers.
4. **Evidence gathering without a final answer** — provider-hosted search,
   fetch, or tool discovery completed after the last visible text item and
   the response stopped without a later answer or answer-bearing output.
5. **Filtered without an answer** — the provider's content filter ended the
   response before its answer. The same request meets the same filter, so
   this is terminal, never retried.

Validation runs on the **final message** of a :class:`ChatResponse` —
the message that would become the agent's final reply for the turn.
Earlier messages in the response are assumed to be tool results or
intermediate text that FunctionInvocationLayer handles separately.
