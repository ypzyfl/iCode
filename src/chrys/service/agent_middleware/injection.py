"""InjectionMiddleware — delivers user messages sent during agent execution.

When a user sends a message while the agent is running (mid-tool-loop),
the text is queued and appended to the messages before the next LLM call.

This is a **ChatMiddleware** (fires per LLM call within the tool loop).
Before each model call, any pending injection texts are appended to
``context.messages`` so the LLM sees them on its next iteration.

Persistence is handled separately by the engine after agent.run() completes,
to ensure correct message ordering in the session history.

One middleware drain is an immutable transaction: all clean wire messages and
retry records are created before the first callback await. A transient retry
replays that transaction outside the cancellable pending queue, preserving its
consumption identities while re-anchoring it to the successful attempt.

    Captures multiple identifying keys because no single one survives every
    framework path:

    - ``contents_ref``: weak reference to the anchor message's ``contents``
      list. Stable in **non-streaming** runs (state stores the same Message
      instances the middleware saw).  Lost in **streaming** runs because
      ``ChatResponse.from_updates`` / ``AgentResponse.from_updates`` rebuild
      every Message from stream updates with brand-new contents lists.

    - ``content_refs``: weak references to the content OBJECTS themselves.
      The kernel wire hands middleware per-call message views — fresh
      wrapper + fresh contents list — so ``contents_ref`` never matches
      state for a viewed message, but the content objects are shared and
      each lives in exactly one state message.

    Identity tiers are WEAK: a dead reference matches nothing (a recycled
    address can never false-match) and an anchor never keeps its source
    alive; placement degrades to the structural fallback, exactly the
    streaming-rebuild path.

    - ``role`` + ``call_ids``: the anchor message's role together with the
      tuple of ``call_id`` values from its ``function_call`` /
      ``function_result`` contents.  Role
      is required because an assistant ``function_call`` and the matching
      tool ``function_result`` share the same call_id; without role the
      injection would land after the assistant call instead of after the
      tool result.  This pair is kept as a fallback because it survives
      streaming rebuilds, but exact identity/message_id are preferred first
      since call ids can be reused by tests, providers, or old replayed
      sessions.

    - ``message_id``: framework-assigned ``Message.message_id`` when set
