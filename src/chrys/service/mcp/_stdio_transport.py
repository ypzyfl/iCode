    Bash function exports (values starting with ``"()"``) are dropped, the

    """``mcp.client.stdio.stdio_client`` variant that ignores banner lines.

    Many real-world stdio MCP servers (vendor CLI wrappers, several
    ``npx`` packages, locally-built tools) violate the spec by emitting
    human-readable startup chatter on stdout before they begin speaking
    JSON-RPC.
    Upstream ``stdio_client`` treats every line as a JSON-RPC message and
    pushes a parse exception onto the read stream when it fails — but the
    base session quietly drops those exceptions, so the pending
    ``initialize()`` waits forever.  The Test button hangs and the agent
    build hangs.

    This wrapper classifies each stdout line into three buckets:

    * **Empty/whitespace-only** — skipped silently (no log, not captured).
    * **Not JSON at all** (``json.loads`` fails) — treated as banner
      chatter.  Dropped.  The first ``MAX_BANNER_LINES_CAPTURED`` banner
      lines are appended to ``dropped_banner_lines`` (when supplied) so
      callers can include them in error messages, and the first one is
      logged at WARNING.  This catches plaintext banners like
      ``"FooBarServer v1.0 (build 42)"`` and bracketed log lines like
      ``"[INFO] starting"``.
    * **Valid JSON but fails JSON-RPC validation** — kept as the
      original "push exception onto read stream" behavior.  Note this
      doesn't surface immediately: ``BaseSession._receive_loop`` routes
      stream exceptions through ``_handle_incoming`` which the default
      handler swallows.  The pending ``initialize()`` then waits until
      ``read_timeout_seconds`` (set via ``request_timeout``) fires.  Our
      ``MCPAdapter`` injects a default ``request_timeout`` floor when
      none is configured, so this case is bounded — but it's "fails
      eventually under the timeout floor", not "fails fast".

    Process lifecycle and shutdown mirror upstream ``stdio_client``.  In
    addition to line handling and the inherited environment, stderr is piped
    into a bounded diagnostic tail and the subprocess return code is recorded
    during shutdown.  Stderr is always drained concurrently so a verbose child
    cannot block on a full pipe.

    This reader is built on private ``mcp.client.stdio`` primitives
    (``_create_platform_compatible_process`` / ``_get_executable_command``
    / ``_terminate_process_tree`` / ``PROCESS_TERMINATION_TIMEOUT``) plus the
    SDK's ``SessionMessage`` wrapper.  If a dependency update removes any of
    them, we degrade to the stock ``stdio_client`` — losing banner tolerance
    and bounded process diagnostics — instead of breaking every stdio MCP
    connection.  The sanitized inherited environment is still forwarded in
    that path by copying it onto the server params.

class _SafeStdioTool(_NoPrePagePingMixin, _StructuredContentFallbackMixin, MCPStdioTool):
    """MCPStdioTool that hardens the stdio transport for chrys.

    Two behaviors layered on top of upstream ``MCPStdioTool``:

    1. **Bounded stderr capture.**  Upstream ``stdio_client`` defaults
       ``errlog=sys.stderr``, inheriting the parent's stderr fd into the
       spawned child.  Inside the Chrys TUI (especially on Python 3.14),
       ``sys.stderr.fileno()`` may raise or return a fd unusable for
       subprocess inheritance, causing ``anyio.open_process`` to fail
       outright.  Even when the fd is valid, child stderr bytes corrupt
       the Chrys TUI frame.  The tolerant transport instead pipes and drains
       stderr into a bounded tail, records the exit code, and uses devnull only
       for the compatibility fallback to the stock SDK client.

    2. **Tolerant stdout reader.**  Many stdio MCP servers (vendor CLI
       wrappers, some ``npx`` packages) emit human-readable banner text on stdout before
       speaking JSON-RPC.  Upstream's reader pushes a parse exception
       onto the read stream — which the base session silently drops —
       leaving the pending ``initialize()`` blocked forever.  We swap in
       :func:`tolerant_stdio_client` which ignores banner lines and
       captures them on ``dropped_banner_lines`` so the adapter can
       surface them in error messages.
