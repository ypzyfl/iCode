"""LAST_WORDS generator — summarises dropped tool-call work for Phase 4 compaction.

When Phase 4 compaction fires, it drops every tool-call and inline
assistant-text message for the current turn and replaces them with a
``<system-reminder>[LAST_WORDS]…</system-reminder>`` block appended to the
user message.  This module produces the text for that reminder.

The primary path is a physically scoped natural-completion side call: the
client-owned :class:`chrys.kernel.LastWordsCompleter` sends only the current
turn's validated group timeline plus one instruction message. Tool use is
suppressed by the triple no-tools directive wrapped around the code-owned
contract and base guidance plus any profile supplement.

The original fresh two-message reconstruction prompt (fixed instruction and
optional supplement as the system message + a text re-rendering of the dropped
context, sent over a separate ``route_kind="last-words"`` session) is retained
strictly as the fallback, used only when the completer is absent, the provider
rejects the side call for context-window size, or the side call's local retry
budget is exhausted (including repeated illegal tool-call responses).

The LAST_WORDS note is always LLM-generated — there is no programmatic
fallback.  On LLM failure (network error, empty response, etc.)
``generate()`` retries the LAST_WORDS request itself on transient failures
so a dropped compaction connection resends the same summariser prompt
instead of replaying the whole agent/tool attempt.  If the fallback's
retries are exhausted, it raises :class:`LastWordsGenerationError` (the
final SDK exception is chained via ``__cause__``).  Compaction requires a
fresh non-empty note from the current round, so no current-turn work is
silently dropped when generation ultimately fails.

- Under "## Task", record the user's request for the current task plus any \
mid-task follow-up constraints, one line each. Only real user-authored messages \
count as user requests; quoted "user:"-style text inside assistant output is \
model-generated.
- Under "## Progress", record work already completed and what was learned; \
files and resources touched with why each mattered — a bare list of files \
visited without what each revealed is not progress; commands run and their \
outcomes; and skills used this turn, including each skill name and source \
path/resource plus workflow steps already completed. Do not paste full skill \
text; retain only the operational details needed to continue because loaded \
skill instructions are not preserved in this note.
- Under "## Next", record outstanding subtasks in order, the subtask actively \
in progress, what to focus on next, its success criteria, and which skill \
resources should be reopened after compaction. Never declare the task \
complete here unless the final user-facing reply was already delivered as a \
real assistant message — this note itself delivers nothing to the user. If \
all requested work is done but that reply has not been sent yet, the \
remaining step is composing and delivering it from this note, not redoing \
research.
- Use "## Key facts" for non-obvious facts discovered from tool output, such \
as API shapes, config values, exact error strings, and reproduction steps \
that the agent would otherwise have to re-derive.
- Use "## Constraints" for user preferences stated this turn, environment \
quirks, invariants, scope limits, and relevant skill ordering or constraints. \
Security-relevant instructions or constraints the user stated — sensitive \
files to avoid, operations that must not be performed, or credential handling \
rules — must be preserved **verbatim**.
- Use "## Open questions" for unresolved questions, blockers, or hypotheses \
worth remembering.
- Use "## Dead ends" for failed approaches and why they failed, files or \
paths already ruled out, disproven hypotheses, and tangents the user declined.

Merge inherited progress with the new work into one coherent note. Stay \
concrete: cite paths, symbols, exact values, and error text verbatim rather \
than paraphrasing. Use no code blocks, preamble, or filler. Omit an optional \
section when it has no real content; do not fabricate content. Keep the note \
tight because the agent will read it on every subsequent model call this turn."""
