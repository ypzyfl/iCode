"""Where workflows live and how their bytes are read once.

Three sources, highest precedence first: the project (``<cwd>/.chrys/workflows``),
the user's global directory (``<config_dir>/workflows``), and the builtin
templates shipped inside chrys. A workflow is a file ``<id>.py`` or, in the
project and global directories, a folder ``<id>/`` whose entry is
``<id>/<id>.py``. For one id the first readable candidate in ``PRECEDENCE``
wins; one that can't be read is reported and shadows nothing. User files are
read owner-verified (no links, no foreign owners) and those bytes are the ones
every later step hashes, confirms and feeds to the worker. A folder's
confirmation covers every file in it except hidden entries and Python's
bytecode caches in ``__pycache__`` folders, through ``WorkflowPackage.digest``.
