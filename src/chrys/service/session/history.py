        When Agent.run errors before HistoryProvider.after_run fires, the user
        message is never stored.  This adds it so ``resume()`` can find it.

        With ``SystemReminderMiddleware``, session state messages are always
        clean (no ``<system-reminder>`` tags), so plain text comparison is
        sufficient for dedup.  When the caller supplies multimodal contents,
        preserve them so retry/follow-up validation can still tell that the
        turn included image bytes.

        Dedup is scoped to the **current turn region** — messages after
        the last ``_chrys_kind='turn'`` marker.  Without scoping, a
        same-text user message from an earlier turn (or an injection
        anchored into one) would make the fallback skip the append and
        lose this turn's user message on interrupt-before-persist.
        Real-world repro: user typed "what time is it?" as an injection
        during turn 1, later typed the same text again as a fresh
        turn-3 user message and interrupted within 1 s → framework
        hadn't stored it yet → fallback saw the earlier injection →
        no append → saved state had interrupted + turn markers for
        turn 3 but no user message, so reload dropped the prompt.
        See ``test_ensure_user_message_appends_when_text_matches_earlier_turn``.

        Dedup is also **kind-aware**: a candidate matches only when text AND
        *kind* agree (``user_text_matches``) — retry guidance (``"injected"``)
        worded identically to the turn opener must append a second, flagged
        message rather than silently dedup against the opener (and vice
        versa).  The matched message's flags are never backfilled: stamping
        the real opener ``_injected`` would stop it opening the turn.
        Recovery never synthesizes a ``"continuation"`` kind — bare-resume
        nudge branches clear the recovery input instead.

        *reminder_source* is the properties of the copy the request sent: an
        appended message carries its reminder record, so later requests
        re-render the reminders it went out with.  A matched message keeps
        its own record.

           persisted its nudge but died before cleanup).  This also covers

           nudge in its region.
        2. Legacy fallback, run **unconditionally** after pass 1: the
           ``text == "continue"`` + ``seen_work`` match for pre-flag
           histories, skipping ``_injected``-flagged messages — a user-typed
           literal ``continue`` follow-up must never be popped in place of a
           synthetic nudge.  Gating pass 2 on "pass 1 removed nothing" would
           strand the legacy nudge of a MIXED region (pre-upgrade unflagged
           leftover + new flagged nudge).  Always running is safe:
           ``seen_work`` requires work *before* the match, so an opener
           whose text is literally ``continue`` is untouchable.

        Scoping matters: a user may legitimately type ``"continue"``
        as a nudge mid-turn in an earlier turn (e.g. "explain X" →
        partial response → user types "continue" → assistant
        finishes).  A global forward scan would trip ``seen_work`` on
        that earlier turn's assistant message and pop the earlier

        by position: positional zips misattribute whenever a pre-run
        unbatched straggler, an interrupted pass, or mid-pass compression
        shifts the pairing.  Deliberately NO ``tool_order`` and NO chrys-id
        fallback (an order-only match hits a stale slot *uniquely*, and the
        chrys id may be a fresh uuid that matches nothing); a record
        without ``provider_call_id`` is dropped with a debug log — for
        batch attribution, loss beats misattribution.

        Duplicate keys are matched **bucketed, never per record**:
        sequential-id providers reset ids per response, so the same key
        legitimately repeats within one pass.  Records group per key in

        order; for N records only the NEWEST N slots stay eligible (surplus
        oldest slots are stale stragglers and stay un-batched), then
        records assign chronologically within the bucket.  Slots are
        (message, function_call content) pairs; the first record assigned
        to a message writes ``_batch_id``, later records verify the id
        matches and no-op (debug log on mismatch, never overwrite).  The
        scan bound is the current turn region — identity matching is what
