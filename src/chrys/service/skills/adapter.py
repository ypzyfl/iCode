"""Skills adapter — converts chrys SkillsConfig into a ChrysSkillsProvider.

Composes the chrys-owned skills stack:

* File-based skills are discovered by :mod:`chrys.service.skills.loader`
  (``SKILL.md`` frontmatter plus recursive, extension-based resource/script
  discovery up to the loader's ``search_depth``). The first ``SKILL.md`` on a
  branch owns all nested content; load failures for discovered roots surface
  as TUI warnings carrying the actual reason.
* Inline YAML skills become :class:`chrys.service.skills.model.Skill`
  instances with synthesized XML content.
* Both are merged and deduplicated (file skills win) before being served
  to :class:`ChrysSkillsProvider` through an async loader callable.

The provider's :meth:`initialize` is awaited inside
:func:`create_skills_provider` so callers can synchronously query
``skill_names()`` / ``skill_sources()`` / ``skill_details()`` right after the
provider is built, even though discovery is otherwise lazy/per-refresh.

SKILLS_STATIC_PROMPT = """\
You have access to skills — packaged domain expertise with instructions, \
reference resources, and executable scripts.

Skills use progressive disclosure: the current runtime skill catalog is appended \
to the latest user message in a system reminder. That catalog shows names, \
descriptions, revisions, and file-based skill directories when available. Full \
content is loaded on demand via skill tools.

## Using skills

1. **Match**: When a task aligns with a skill's description, or the user \
explicitly requests one, proceed to step 2. If multiple skills match, choose \
the most specific. If none apply, proceed normally without loading any skill.

2. **Load**: Call `load_skill` with the skill name to retrieve full \
instructions. The response may list resources and scripts available for that \
skill. Do not re-load a skill already loaded in this conversation unless the \
latest runtime catalog shows a changed skill or the user asks you to refresh it.

3. **Follow**: Execute the loaded instructions. When they reference \
supporting material:
   - Call `read_skill_resource` to read any referenced resource.
{runner_instructions}
   - Pass exact ordered script tokens via the `arguments` array \
(e.g. `arguments: ["input.txt", "output.txt"]`). Use `arguments` for \
subcommands, short flags, repeated flags, global flags before a subcommand, \
and `--` passthrough. Use `args` only as optional sugar for flat, \
order-insensitive CLI flags.

## Parameter naming

Use names exactly as listed — preserve directory prefixes, do not append \
file extensions to skill names:
- `skill_name`: e.g. `"style-guide"` (not `"style-guide.md"`)
- `resource_name`: e.g. `"references/FAQ.md"` (not `"FAQ.md"`)
- `script_name`: e.g. `"scripts/convert.py"` (not `"convert.py"`)
  File-based script names are paths relative to the skill directory, using \
forward slashes on every platform. A script stored at \
`<skill_dir>/scripts/{{skill_script_name}}.py` must be invoked with \
`script_name: "scripts/{{skill_script_name}}.py"`, not \
`"{{skill_script_name}}.py"`.

## Constraints

- Always call `load_skill` before accessing a skill's resources or scripts.
- Only use skill tools to interact with skill content — do not use \
file-read or shell tools to access skill files directly.
- Always execute skill scripts via `run_skill_script`. Never run them \
through shell/bash/zsh/pwsh/powershell tools (e.g. `bash scripts/convert.py`, \
`python scripts/convert.py`, `./scripts/convert.py`) — the skill runner \
handles skill-path validation, interpreter selection, timeouts, approval, \
and provenance consistently. The runner is not a security sandbox: scripts \
retain the user's normal file, network, and process privileges and inherit \
most of the iCode process environment. Use executable skills only from \
sources you trust.
- Do not verify script file existence before calling `run_skill_script`; \
the skill system resolves paths internally.
- Scripts run in the user's primary working directory by default. \
When the catalog lists a `skill_dir` for a skill, it is an absolute path for \
the current platform. Use it to build an absolute `cwd` or argument when the \
skill needs paths relative to its package. Override via the `cwd` parameter \
only when needed, and pass an absolute path (relative paths are rejected).
